## Project Goal

This project explores how to leverage **Large Language Models (LLMs)** to support developmental assessment tasks in children. It integrates **retrieval capabilities** through **Langchain's Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** pipeline, enabling intelligent and context-aware question answering.

In addition, the project also includes a **classification model** that applies machine learning models such as:

- Decision Tree  
- XGBoost  
- CatBoost  
- **Online Local Accuracy (OLA)**

These models are trained and evaluated on a real-world dataset to **predict the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD)** in children.

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository
2. Install the dependencies
3. Load the model and run the RAG pipeline
4. Enjoy the interaction with your intelligent assistant!
